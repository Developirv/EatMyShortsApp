## EAT MY SHORTS

## Introduction

The Eat My Shorts app will serve as a companion piece to complement the current podcast available on Spotify/ Apple Podcasts.

The app will serve as a tracker for the show hosts to know which episodes they have already published and which episodes are still needed in the context of the material covered. An example would be that the hosts can look at the entries on the app, and see that they have covered 4 episodes from season 6 and no episodes from season 2, this visual aid will not only enhance the show prep, but it will also allow fans to look at the data the show hosts have for each episode, setting up to be a "premium feature" that can be given to Patreon subscribers by creating a username for them. Adversely, the show hosts can use the data taken from the "episode ratings" to engage with listeners and be used as a sort of "market reasearch" to help develop future plots and episode topics.

A user will be able to see original content derived by episode, including show notes, and tracking information such as date of origin, characters referenced, and ongoing show segments that may have been referenced in the podcast.

The "Create An Episode" entry will allow the hosts to add in the following new data to the episode database: 

   Episode Title: 
   Episode Description: 
   Episode Date: 
   Episode Original Air Date:
   Episode Show Notes: 
   Episode Rating: 
   Episode Link: 

   Upon clicking "submit" this information will be added to the database with other previous Episode entries.

## Unsolved Problems

I will list the unsolved problems left after sprint completion here.

## Future Enhancements

A "Simpsons did it" feature that allows users to see popular existing Simpsons memes derived from each episode entry.

A "Stealing my bit" feature that allows users to see original memes made by the show hosts derived from each episode entry.

An "Androids dungeon" feature that allows the user to buy original artwork made for each episode entry by the hosts.

##  React Information below for project needs. Will Delete prior to final commit. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
